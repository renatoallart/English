I never believed on that kind thing "a light at the end of the tunnel"

After near death experience some people says "I saw the light" with cold sweat rolling down of their faces.

but I'm still here in this so-called "tunnel".

who did I die?

the last thing I can remember


was being alone in my room looking at the under city 
I was alone in my room.

after that 

I felt my body heavy while I lay down in the bed.
