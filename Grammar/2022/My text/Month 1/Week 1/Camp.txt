Camp

My 

next weekend i gonna camp on the beach with some friends,
but it concerns me, i don't know anything about camp.
then i searching on the internet about camp,
i find a website "camp for morons" i encounter everything that i needed there.
how to set up a tent, cooking, put away insects, etc... 
i spent hours reading about camp therefore i become the camp master.
at the night one day before the camp, a friend calls me and says the camp has been canceled due to heavy rain.

Next weekend I'm going camping on the beach with my friends.
But I'm concerned because I don't know anything about camping. 
I looked it up on the internet and found a website called "Camping for Morons." 
It assists me with whatever we need (the set, cooking, avoiding insects, etc...)
I spent hours reading about camping, and now I'm a camping master.
I received a call the night before we left, and a friend told me the trip was cancelled due to rain.
