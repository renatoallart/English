a litter wings, the front-legs were biggest than back-legs.
I ran faster than I could, but he got me and he looked at me and say; life or death?

Today, i was dreaming; I were chasing by a stone bull, His had red eyes, 
a litter wings, the front-legs were biggest than back-legs.
I ran faster than I could, but he got me and he looked at me and say; life or death?
