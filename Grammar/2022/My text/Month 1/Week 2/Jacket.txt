My

Me - Hey Lisa what are you think about my new jacket? cool? 
Lisa - not bad, you look like those clowns that appear on tv.
Me - seriously? no way, just because of the color? 
what's wrong red with the yellow sleeve?
Lise - nothing at all, if you like, I'll not argue with you.

Lisa - Not bad, you look like those clowns that appear on tv.
Me - Seriously? No way, just because of the color! 
What’s wrong red with yellow sleeves?
Lise - Nothing at all, if you like, I won’t argue.

(The exclamation point makes it a statement not a question.
