Late


I just looked at the clock to know what time it's,that's ok I ain't late it's 9:12am yet. 
When I looked at my bus go away. While I see it my heart speed up.
If I get late one more time I make sure that sucker will fire me.


Jiu-Jitsu

Buddy - Hey man are you went to the shop yesterday to buy the new Spider-man magazine?
Me - Nope, I took my grandmother to jiu-jitsu, I spent two hours there. 
When I went out it was already 8:00pm. Then I gonna go there today.
Buddy - I tag along with you, I need to buy new clothes.

Stand up

I'd already given up to stay there when my name finally was called.
